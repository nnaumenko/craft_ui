## Prerequisites

Only a JS-enabled browser is required. No fancy modern technologies are used so far.

## License

The project is available under MIT licence. See LICENSE.md for details.

### Program part workflow

We take a look at the existing User Interfaces / Glass Cockpits for the real/existing aircraft or spacecraft we manage to find on the internet. Whenever possible the child learns why exactly the modification can or cannot be implemented in the way proposed. 

We either print or draw these Glass Cockpit User Interfaces or sometimes we just review it without drawing, printing or reviewing.

Then we review look-and-feel of the Glass Cockpit in the fictional craft, decide how exactly it should work and write down / finalise the functions of the fictional craft together for its functions.

Then we discuss again, customise / 'improve'/ the functions.

The toy flying craft itself is being rebuilt or modified in accordance with the new cusomised details. 

### Physical part

The physical part is typically made of Lego Classic. The design modification or their details are scanned from the paper or photographed with a tablet and kept in a separate directory. This might be released later as a part of this project at some point.

The child takes his part in R&D works and under the adult's supervision learns the feasibility of the modified design.

The child reviews and makes sure the drawings & drafts are in accordance with the model and the functions built in reality match the drafts created as a part of this project.

Due to nature of the project (built by an adult and a child), no timeline is set so far.

## References

The project is standalone and does not have dependencies such as .js libraries.

When 'refresh' in browser is pressed, a new User Interface is generated and all the new changes are applied together.
