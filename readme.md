# Animation for children, procedurally generated user interface for a fictional flying craft

## Toy project for the child and father.

A child's toy, a very simple generated image/animation of a user interface for a fictional flying craft.

## Program part

### Workflow

First we take a look at the existing user interfaces and/or glass cockpits for the real aircraft or even spacecraft which we manage to find on the internet.

Whenever possible the child learns why exactly the wanted modification can or cannot be implemented in the way proposed. 

We either print or draw these glass cockpit user interfaces or sometimes we just review it without printing or drawing.

Then we review the look-and-feel of the glass cockpit in our fictional craft, decide how exactly it should work. We write down and analyse the purposes of the fictional craft's functions. Then we discuss again, customise and 'improve' the functions. We make it as realistic as possible but of course it cannot stay realistic all the time.

### Prerequisites

Only a JS-enabled browser is required. No fancy modern technologies are used so far.

### License

The project is available under MIT licence. See LICENSE.md for details.

## Physical part

The toy flying craft itself is being rebuilt or modified in accordance with the new cusomised details of the user interface if needed. 

The physical part of the toy flying craft is typically made of Lego Classic parts set.

The child takes his part in R&D works and under the father's supervision learns the feasibility of the modified design whenever possible.

The design modification or their details are scanned from the paper or photographed with a tablet and kept in a separate directory (it might be started to be released later as a part of this project at some point).

The child reviews and makes sure the drawings & drafts (and subsequently Lego builds) are in accordance with the model. 

The functions of the flying craft built in from Legos must match the program part of this project. For example if we focus on combining VTOL craft capabilities with high speed airplane-like capabilities, both program user interface design and physical Lego build must consider the combination of these features. Of course the features cannot remain realistic as the project is ultimately a child's toy, aimed at learning and exploring but still a toy nevertheless (otherwise we would just have to stop at V-22 Osprey or V-280 Valor - which is nice but is not the project's goal!).

Due to the nature of the project (built by an adult and a child together and done outside office/daycare hours), no strict plan or timeline can be set.

## References

The project is standalone and does not have dependencies such as .js libraries.

When 'refresh' in browser is pressed, a new User Interface is generated and all the new changes are applied together.
